    "    * Without using any package for OLS regression, use `Python` to directly write down the estimates and standard errors using the OLS estimator and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.\n",
    "    * Use the package `statsmodels` to estimate the model and report the estimates and standard errors.\n",
    "    * Use the package `pystata` to call `Stata` from `Python` to estimate the model and report the estimates and standard errors. \n",

    "4. **Resampling**: \n",
    "    * Randomly draw a sample of size 500 from the data set and calculate the OLS estimates and standard errors of $\\alpha_1$ for model (4) using the sample. \n",
    "    * Repeat the above step 1000 times, store your estimates and standard errors:\n",
    "      *  Plot the distribution of your estimates and standard errors and draw the estimate/standard errors of $\\alpha_1$ obtained from question 3. \n",
    "      *  Calculate the standard deviation of your estimates and compare it with the standard error of $\\alpha_1$ obtained from question 3.\n",
    "    *  Wrap up your code in a function called `ols_resampling` that takes the data set and the number of resamples as arguments."
